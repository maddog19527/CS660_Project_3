# CS660 Project 3

## Project Overview
-This project is the final assignment for CS660-Mathematical Foundations of Analytics, a course in Pace University's Masters in Data Science program.
-The primary goal of this project is to perform classification and regression analysis tasks on specific datasets, using scikit.learn library tools.

## Dataset Description
Digits-
The sklearn digits dataset is a collection of 8x8 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), often used for classification and image recognition tasks.
California_Housing-
The sklearn California housing dataset is a regression dataset derived from the 1990 U.S. Census, containing information about housing in California. It includes 20,640 samples with 8 features, such as median income, average number of rooms, and latitude/longitude, used to predict the median house value in a given block. 

## Questions Answered
How can we most effectively and efficiently tune the default Classification and Regression tools available to us in the SKLearn library?
How can we use visualizations and GeoPandas to add depth to our feature engineering?
